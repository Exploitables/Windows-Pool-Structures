# Windows Pool Structures
My love for learning Windows internals continues.

This repository will contain every Windows kernel pool structure from Windows XP to Windows 11. Though, this will take a lot of time! I will be utilizing a program known as ("WinDbg To C")[https://github.com/markhc/windbg_to_c] to assist my efforts in accurately converting these structures.

You are free to use these structures. Though, I would appreciate credits to this repository (for the sake of motivation). Additionally, bare in mind that these structures may not be correct! Double-check to ensure that the structures were reversed correctly, and if they are not, please create an issue.

Knowledge should not be locked away behind a license or a pay wall.

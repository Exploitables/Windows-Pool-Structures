# Windows Pool Structures
 My love for learning Windows internals continues.

You are free to use these structures. Though, I would appreciate credits to this repository (for the sake of motivation). Additionally, bare in mind that these structures may not be correct! Double-check to ensure that the structures were reversed correctly, and if they are not, please create an issue.

Knowledge should not be locked away behind a license or a pay wall.
